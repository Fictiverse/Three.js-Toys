# Simulation Project

This project includes three main pages for exploring different aspects of simulations: **Potential**, **Rule30**, and **Matter**.

## Navigation

Click one of the links below to access the corresponding page:

- [Potential](Potential.html): Explores potentials in simulations.
- [Rule30](Rule30.html): Displays a cellular automaton based on Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.
- [Matter](Matter.html): Experiments with basic particle interactions.

## Project Structure

- **Potential.html**: Simulates interaction potentials between different entities.
- **Rule30.html**: Implements Rule 30, a one-dimensional cellular automaton generating fractal patterns.
- **Matter.html**: Enacts specific interaction rules for particles.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fictiverse/Three.js-Toys
